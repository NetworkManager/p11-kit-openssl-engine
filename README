p11-remote
==========

This is a PKCS#11 engine for OpenSSL based on p11-kit capable of utilizing the
p11-kit remoting capabilities. Please note that this engine module is
experimental and is not up to the feature parity with libp11 based
pkcs11_engine (which wpa_supplicant uses by default). It might be possible to
extend the pkcs11_engine to include the remoting functionality. In that case
this module will be rendered obsolete.

It also includes an on-demand activated UNIX socket based p11-kit server for
user sessions.

This is in particular useful to use a GNOME Keyring software HSM with daemons
running outside the user session, such as the NetworkManager managed VPN
daemons or wpa_supplicant.
